Abstract:
People frequently suffer from cancer, a serious condition that comes in numerous forms. Lung cancer is frequently diagnosed in smokers. Lung cancer can be brought on by smoking, exposure to chemicals, secondhand smoke, and genetic predisposition. Up to 45% of deaths are attributable to lung cancer. Therefore, early detection and prediction are crucial. Non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer are the two main subtypes of lung cancer. Lung cancer patients' lives can be saved with the use of early predictions. Statistical techniques are typically used to categorize cancer risk as either high risk or low risk. One of the greatest methods for cancer diagnosis is histopathology image analysis. Managing the complex relationships of high dimensional data can be challenging at times. These limitations brought on by the enormous dimensions of the data can be solved using machine learning techniques. Lung cancer is one of the most common diseases in the world, making a correct diagnosis essential for effective treatment. It is really difficult to categorize all of the slide photos (WSIs). It is challenging to create big training datasets since pixelwise WSI annotations take a long time. Furthermore, heterogeneous patterning is frequently seen in high magnification fields of lung cancer tissue pictures, which presents significant difficulties. Direct analysis of WSIs is not feasible due to the incalculable processing expense of doing so for a gigapixel of data. Therefore, we will use the best machine learning algorithms in this procedure to forecast lung cancer
